### Reproducibility repo for Shashikadze et al. "Multi-omics profiling of lungs from genetically diabetic pigs reveals reduced ALOX15 levels and impaired eicosanoid switching as mechanisms contributing to a proinflammatory milieu".

Proteomics dataset can be downloaded from [ProteomeExchange](http://www.proteomexchange.org/) repository (dataset identifier - PXD038014)

Lipidomics dataset can be found in supplementary materials of the paper
